We originally planned to eat at a different Japanese restaurant in Midtown, but we decided to abandon that when we realized the wait time would be 30 minutes to an hour &#x1F635;&#x200D;&#x1F4AB;. </p><p>Serendipitously, NONONO was just a couple blocks away, so we decided to wander in. (Side note: I love how abundant amazing restaurants are in NYC.) We got lucky and didn&apos;t even have to wait for a table! I imagine that it can get pretty crowded though, so I&apos;d recommend making a reservation before you go. </p><p>First, the ambiance was beautiful. From the furniture to the table setting, everything was very minimalistic and artsy. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://asl3.github.io/my-blog/content/images/2024/03/IMG_0954.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="NONONO?

I thought it was super special, and I&apos;d say it&apos;s a must-order dish here &#x1F60D;. It also pairs wonderfully with ramen, especially a spicy soup.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://asl3.github.io/my-blog/content/images/2024/03/IMG_0956.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="NONONO?

I&apos;m personally not the biggest fan of cream-based sauces, so this wasn&apos;t my favorite. I also would have preferred the noodle texture to be more al-dente. However, if you like this kind of dish I still would recommend trying it!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://asl3.github.io/my-blog/content/images/2024/03/IMG_0957.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="NONONO?

I got the Tori Tantan ramen, and to this day it is the best soup-based ramen I&apos;ve had. The soup was flavorful and the noodles were perfectly al-dente (unlike the Code Roe Cream Udon). </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://asl3.github.io/my-blog/content/images/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-04-at-8.30.16-AM.png" class="kg-image" alt="NONONO?

(Although, our first date was actually at a ramen place in DC, lol. He didn&apos;t know at the time.) As in, at the beginning of our relationship I&apos;d always order a dry noodle dish, even if we were at a place that specialized in something like ramen or pho. </p><p>Matt on the other hand lives for a good bowl of ramen or &#x5170;&#x5DDE;&#x62C9;&#x9762; (lan zhou la mian, beef noodle soup), and through exposure therapy I have started to gain appreciation for a warm soupy bowl of noodles. Of the amazing noodle soups I&apos;ve had, the Tori Tantan Ramen definitely takes the cake!</p><p>I don&apos;t exactly remember which ramen bowls Matt and Brian ordered, but I know one of them got the Shio Paitan Ramen, another one of NONONO&apos;s most popular dishes. Matt got the Experience Set, which includes your choice of Yakitori and a drink with the ramen.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://asl3.github.io/my-blog/content/images/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-04-at-8.47.04-AM.png" class="kg-image" alt="NONONO?

In terms of pricing, each ramen bowl was less than $20, which is really good for NYC! That&apos;s less than somewhere like Ippudo, even though in my opinion it&apos;s better :). </p><p>If you try it out, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
